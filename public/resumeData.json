    "bio":"Coming to programming because of my passion for games, I chose this industry because I played games very well since childhood but I know programming it really is not as simple as playing games. I missed my first 2 years in college because I was giddy. And in 2018 I started to focus on the first lines of code, I started with c and c ++, from there my passion for programming returned and I joined the Oplympic team at university. . I had an award at school but I know my orientation is to make practical applications so I applied for an internship and work until now.",
